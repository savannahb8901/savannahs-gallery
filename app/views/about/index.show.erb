        <p class="mx-auto">My name is Savannah Bowman. I currently attend the University of Chicago as an Economics and Visual Arts Major. 

Ever since I was little, I’ve always thought more on the right side of the brain. I prefer holistic thought, imagination, and creativity to analytic thought, reasoning, and number skills. During my art classes I found it easy to express my feelings, thoughts, and new ideas through my work. I love how diverse art can be and the infinite possibilities in which one can express themselves. 
​
My concentration celebrates the essence of black people through intimate representation. My paintings portray the beauty of black people. I consider each person I paint as an attribute of myself, whether it be strength, fear, endurance, love. Painting has served as a form of meditation and relief; a portal that detaches me from the weight of the world. ​</p>
